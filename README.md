Hello folks,
It is a very basic bash script to install apache on the linux machine, initially the script will determine the linux distribution and then it will proceed with the installation.
Once apache is installed you can install wordpress on your server using this script if you need, you need to install and configure MYSQL before proceeding with the wordpress installtion.
